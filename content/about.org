I am an educator and writer interested in digital humanities, linguistics, and farming. I like maps and long hikes. One of my dreams is to build a small farmstead with beekeeping, various fermentation capabilities (kimchi, cheese, and Czech pilseners), and an [[https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/03/24/umberto-eco-antilibrary/][antilibrary]].

I teach British and American literature at [[https://waterfordschool.org][Waterford School]] in Sandy, Utah.

My educational background is in linguistics ([[https://linguistics.stanford.edu/people/phd-alumni][Ph.D.]] and M.A., Stanford University) and German ([[https://german.georgetown.edu/people/alumni#MA%20Recip][M.A.]], Georgetown University). I graduated /summa cum laude/ from the University of California, Irvine, and studied German language and literature at GÃ¶ttingen.

This website is maintained with the open source [[https://gohugo.io/][Hugo engine]] and is hosted (currently) on [[https://github.com/linguistgate/public_workspace][Github]] and served through [[https://netlify.com][Netlify]].

I believe in maintaining control over my content even if the personal webpage has become sadly antiquated, and I hold fast to the idea that the Web should be a space of contributory individual expression, not compartmentalization, reactionary amplification, lock-down, and lock-in. To that extent, my Web presence through Phantisocracy is political.

/The title of my public Web presence, Phantisocracy, refers to the utopian ideal set forth by Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Robert Southey in the 1790s. Their pantisocratic ideals were never concretely realized. A phantisocracy is my term of art for any utopian scheme that remains hypothetical./
