One of my goals for my first year in Utah was to undertake a long backpacking trip. I ended up backpacking for five days in the [High Uintas Wilderness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Uintas_Wilderness), through some beautiful territory. I climbed Kings Peak, the highest point in Utah, marked at around 13,528 feet above sea level. Along the way, I camped under rain and stars, startled moose and sheep, and stretched my legs and soul in a time of pandemic and uncertainty.
