Earlier today, this post appeared on my website written completely from my iPhone 7 --- using a purchased version of Working Copy. I'm trying to increase commitment to this space. Part of the commitment is rethinking of Phantisocracy as a digital garden of tended, manicured, and often incomplete (and therefore growing) posts. This is part of a very naive jump into Zettelkastens, Evergreen notes, and a different way of managing my digital life and knowledge management systems.

On his blog, Greg Restall [[https://consequently.org/news/2018/with-help-from-hugo-github-netlify-working-copy-and-shortcuts-i-might-update-this-website-more-frequently/][has a post about using GitHub, Netlify, Hugo, and Working Copy in tandem]] to accomplish a very similar outcome. He suggests using iOS Shortcuts system to create some usable templates. I can foresee using the iPhone for short microposts or "seedlings," in the sense that Maggie Appleton describes in her [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXXXHN516qc][YouTube interview by Robert Halsfield on Roam Research.]]

Another relevant post is Evan Brown's [[http://evanbrown.io/post/hugo-on-the-go/][writeup on Travis and Working Copy]]. The post contains some tips on using a markdown template to get started and encourages integration of pictures. The Travis part of the post is less relevant for me because I'm using GitHub and Netlify.

The upshot of this post is to document that I've finally achieved something I've been putting into my snippet red Mao book for so long: post frequently, purposefully, and independently of my office setup.
